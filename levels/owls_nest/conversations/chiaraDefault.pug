    You seemed to be relieved I made it into The Cloud alive...

      I've cleared the security pylons - what should I do next?

      I was asked to report here for a critical mission - should we get started?

        Neural interface is stable... All life signs within normal parameters.
        You're here, and you're alive! Isn't that wonderful!

        Hi !{settings.name}! Are you feeling okay? Is there anything I can help with?

        Oh, right, sure, of course. <span class="highlight">Chiara</span>, 
        chief medical officer with the TwilioQuest program. I actually designed 
        the new neural interface through which you are experiencing The Cloud. <br/><br/>
        It would be a pleasure to meet you in any event, but today it is a
        particular thrill - I wasn't quite sure this version of the interface 
        was going to work!
    
    statement#relieved
      text.
        Did I? Oh, no, I assure you, the neural interface is completely safe.<br/><br/>
        On an unrelated note - you don't happen to smell fish, do you?

    statement#tell_right_away
      text.
        I know, what a silly question. Why would you? There's no fish around here!<br/><br/>
        But if you do start smelling fish, you need to tell me RIGHT AWAY, do 
        you understand? Good? Good.

        Proceed through the medical bay door into the tech lab. Margaret will 
        want to speak with you next - she'll equip you with a
        <span class="highlight">critical tool</span> you'll need while exploring
        The Cloud. Good luck out there!

    statement#test_motor
      text.
        I'll need you to use <span class="highlight">basic movement and interaction controls</span>
        to activate a switch near the exit to the medical bay. If you can do so,
        we can be confident that your neural interface is configured correctly.<br/><br/>
        You can move your avatar using the <span class="highlight">arrow keys, or the W, A, S, and D keys</span>.
        You can interact with objects - the switch, for instance - 
        using the <span class="highlight">spacebar</span>.

    statement#get_started

        Indeed. You've been selected from thousands of Operators to take command
        of a prototype Cloud Exploration Vessel we call the 
        <span class="highlight">Fog Owl</span>.
        The Owl represents years of research and billions of dollars in cutting 
        edge technology. More importantly, it could finally let us stay one step 
        ahead of the Legacy Systems.<br/><br/> Before we worry about any 
        of that, though, we'll need to check your basic motor functions and ensure
        you are fit for duty.
