    Do you make a habit of breaking stuff?

      Looks like the hacking tool works as advertised. No more laser barrier.

      Now that I have the hacking device, what should I do?

      I understand you have a tool that might help me with the mission?

        Walk up to an object you think might be hackable, and press the 
        <span class="highlight">spacebar</span>. That should bring up the hacking 
        interface. The hacking interface will present you with some kind of 
        challenge - you might need to write code, answer some questions... stuff like that.
        <br/><br/>Complete the challenge as described, and SHAZAM! Whatever was
        locked before is locked no more.

          Oh, you grabbed the hacking tool off the pedestal? That's great! 
          It's for you! For adventure!<br/><br/>
          You should try it out on the 
          <span class="highlight">terminal attached to those pesky lasers</span>
          over there.

          You better believe I do. It's that <span class="highlight">hacking tool 
          sitting on the pedestal over there</span>. With that little wonder, 
          you'll be able to break all kinds of things - in the name of justice 
          of course.<br/><br/> You can use the hacking tool to bypass locked doors, 
          open chests, and notably, to <span class="highlight">shut down laser barriers</span> 
          like the one in this room.

        <span class="highlight">Margaret</span>, and very pleased to make 
        your acquaintance. I'm an experimental scientist in the TwilioQuest 
        program, and the inventor of the super-duper-handy hacking tool you'll 
        use on your adventures. <br/><br/> I have basically the best job ever - 
        I get to break things, and put them back together again, and no one 
        seems to mind!

        I wouldn't say it's a habit so much as a sacred calling. I lost track of 
        how many times as a kid I took apart our VCR and put it back together again.

        Unsure if I am being trolled, or am just legitimately super old.

        I usually had a few extra parts left over, but our VHS tapes of Ghostbusters 
        still seemed to work. So I guess it was fine?

        With your hackery complete, you'll want to head through the door to meet 
        <span class="highlight">Cedric and Kevin</span>. After that, I think you're off on your 
        big adventure aboard the Fog Owl. I'm so proud our little bird is about
        to leave the nest!
