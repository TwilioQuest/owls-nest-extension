  chief medical officer with the TwilioQuest program. I actually designed 
  the new neural interface through which you are experiencing The Cloud. <br/><br/>
  It would be a pleasure to meet you in any event, but today it is a

  I'd say he's become an even better human than I am! I'm very proud of

  'owls_nest.kevinCedricDefault.kevin_conversation_index': `Sure - what did you want to talk about?`,
  'owls_nest.kevinCedricDefault.kevin_espresso_machine': `Right? I didn't know if we'd actually use it, but it turns out we do all 
  the time.`,
  'owls_nest.kevinCedricDefault.kevin_get_started': `We can't wait to see what the Owl can do either! Top of the line packet 
  transmission drive, advanced location encryption, and an espresso machine!
  <br/><br/>The Fog Owl is tough, fast, and stealthy. Once you shake it

  across The Cloud.`,

  When I was developing the Fredric software, I was always focused on
